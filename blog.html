          1. Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`
        </h1>
        <div class="text-justify">
          <p>
            The scope of variables in JavaScript is determined by whether they
            are declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            1.`var`: Variables declared with `var` have function-level scope or
            global scope, depending on where they are declared. This means they
            are accessible throughout the function or globally if declared
            outside of any function. However, `var` variables are not
            block-scoped, which means they can be accessed outside of blocks
            like if statements and loops.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2.`let`: Variables declared with `let` have block-level scope. They
            are limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are
            declared, such as inside a function, loop, or conditional statement.
            This allows for more fine-grained control over variable visibility
            and prevents accidental variable leaks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            3. `const`: Variables declared with `const` also have block-level
            scope, similar to `let`. However, `const` variables cannot be
            reassigned after they are initialized. While the value they hold is
            constant, the variable itself cannot be redeclared within the same
            scope.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In summary, `var` has broader scope rules and is less predictable
            compared to `let` and `const`, which have more localized block-level
            scope. Using `let` and `const` is generally recommended over `var`
            as they offer better control and help avoid common bugs associated
            with variable hoisting and accidental reassignments.

          2.Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`
        </h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            `null` and `undefined` are two distinct values in JavaScript with
            different use cases.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            `null`: The `null` value is often used to represent the intentional
            absence of any object value or the absence of a value that should
            exist. It is a way to explicitly indicate that a variable, property,
            or function argument does not have a meaningful value at a given
            point in the code. For example, you might set a variable to `null`
            to indicate that it has not been assigned any meaningful data yet.
            `null` is typically used when you want to signify that something is
            deliberately empty or missing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            `undefined`: The `undefined` value represents the absence of a value
            or the uninitialized state of a variable. It occurs when a variable
            is declared but has not been assigned any value, or when you access
            an object property that does not exist. `undefined` can also be used
            as a default value for function parameters when the caller does not
            provide an argument. It's important to note that `undefined` is
            often an indicator of a programming mistake or oversight and should
            be handled carefully to avoid unexpected behavior.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            In summary, `null` is used when you want to explicitly indicate the
            absence of a value, while `undefined` typically represents the
            absence or uninitialized state of a variable or property.
            Understanding the differences between these two values is important
            for writing clean and error-free JavaScript code.

            3. What do you mean by REST API?
          </h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
            Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and
            interacting with web services. It is an architectural style for
            designing networked applications and relies on a stateless
            communication protocol, typically HTTP. REST APIs are widely used
            for enabling communication and data exchange between client
            applications (such as web or mobile apps) and server-side services
            or resources.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>Key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs include:</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            1.tatelessness: Each HTTP request from a client to a server
            must contain all the information needed to understand and process
            the request. The server should not rely on any previous requests or
            maintain session state between requests.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2. Resources: In a REST API, resources are the key abstractions.
            Resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) and can
            represent objects, data, or services. Resources can be manipulated
            using standard HTTP methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (create
            data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            3. HTTP Methods: REST APIs map CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
            Delete) operations to HTTP methods:
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            - `GET`: Retrieve data. <br> - `POST`: Create new data. <br> - `PUT`: Update
            existing data (usually replacing it entirely). <br> - `PATCH`: Partially
            update existing data. <br>   - `DELETE`: Remove data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            4. URL Structure: URLs are used to identify and access
            resources. They should be structured hierarchically and
            meaningfully, representing the relationships between resources.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            5. Representation: Resources can have multiple representations,
            such as JSON, XML, or HTML, to facilitate data exchange between
            clients and servers. Clients can specify their preferred
            representation through HTTP headers.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            6. Stateless Communication: RESTful APIs do not maintain client
            state on the server between requests. Each request is independent,
            and the client is responsible for managing its own state.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            7. Uniform Interface: A uniform and consistent interface
            simplifies interactions between clients and servers, making it
            easier for developers to understand and use the API.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            REST APIs have become the standard for designing web services due to
            their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use. They are widely used
            in web and mobile app development for accessing and manipulating
            data on remote servers, integrating with third-party services, and
            enabling interoperability between different systems and platforms.
